N teams play in a round-robin soccer tournament where each team plays every other team once.

Each game has three possible outcomes: 
  * win for first team
  * win for second team or 
  * a draw
Points:
  * If a team wins the game then it receives W points.
  * If the game is a draw then both teams receive D points.
  * The losing team receives no points.

------------------------------------------
 
Problem:
  Your task is to reconstruct the result of each game given:
    * the total number of goals scored
    * goals conceded and 
    * points earned by each team

------------------------------------------

TopCoder points:
  You will receive 1 point for predicting a game's outcome (win, loss, draw) correctly.
  You will receive an additional 2 points for also predicting the game's exact score.

==========================================

Here is an example solution for seed=1 with N=6, W=3, D=1 and X=1.
This solution predicts that each game ends in a 1:1 draw.
Five of the games finished in a draw and two of them were exactly 1:1, so the solution achieves 5*1 + 2*2 = 9 points.

INPUT:
team 0 scored 5 conceded 10 points 2
team 1 scored 4 conceded 12 points 1
team 2 scored 6 conceded 4 points 10
team 3 scored 9 conceded 4 points 9
team 4 scored 4 conceded 5 points 5
team 5 scored 11 conceded 4 points 13

OUTPUT:
game 0, team 0 vs team 1, predicted 1:1 actual 2:2 Correct outcome!
game 1, team 0 vs team 2, predicted 1:1 actual 1:2 Wrong
game 2, team 0 vs team 3, predicted 1:1 actual 1:3 Wrong
game 3, team 0 vs team 4, predicted 1:1 actual 1:1 Correct outcome and score!
game 4, team 0 vs team 5, predicted 1:1 actual 0:2 Wrong
game 5, team 1 vs team 2, predicted 1:1 actual 1:2 Wrong
game 6, team 1 vs team 3, predicted 1:1 actual 0:3 Wrong
game 7, team 1 vs team 4, predicted 1:1 actual 0:2 Wrong
game 8, team 1 vs team 5, predicted 1:1 actual 1:3 Wrong
game 9, team 2 vs team 3, predicted 1:1 actual 0:0 Correct outcome!
game 10, team 2 vs team 4, predicted 1:1 actual 1:0 Wrong
game 11, team 2 vs team 5, predicted 1:1 actual 1:2 Wrong
game 12, team 3 vs team 4, predicted 1:1 actual 1:1 Correct outcome and score!
game 13, team 3 vs team 5, predicted 1:1 actual 2:2 Correct outcome!
game 14, team 4 vs team 5, predicted 1:1 actual 0:2 Wrong
