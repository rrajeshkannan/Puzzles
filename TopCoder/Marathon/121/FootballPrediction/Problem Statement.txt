N teams play in a round-robin soccer tournament where each team plays every other team once.

Each game has three possible outcomes: 
  * win for first team
  * win for second team or 
  * a draw
Points:
  * If a team wins the game then it receives W points.
  * If the game is a draw then both teams receive D points.
  * The losing team receives no points.

------------------------------------------

The following are details on how the game outcomes are generated.

In the beginning of the tournament, each team is assigned two values. These values do not change throughout the tournament.
  * an attack strength and 
  * a defence strength

Each game is generated using X independent simulations.
  * Each simulation consists of 6 rounds:
      * 3 rounds when the first team is attacking and 
      * 3 rounds when the second team is attacking.
  * One round of team 1 attacking team 2 is simulated like so:
      * A1 is chosen uniformly at random between 1 and team 1's attack strength, inclusive.
      * D2 is chosen uniformly at random between 1 and team 2's defence strength, inclusive.
      * If A1 > D2 then team 1 scores one goal.
  * Similarly we simulate team 2 attacking team 1.
  * Since there are 3 attacking rounds for each team, the most number of goals a team can score is 3.
  * The final game score is the rounded average of all X simulation scores.
  * For example, 
      * suppose X=3 and we generated the following scores: 3:2, 3:0 and 2:2.
      * The first team scored on average (3+3+2)/3 = 2.67 goals, while the second team scored on average (2+0+2)/3 = 1.33 goals. 
      * After the rounding the final game score will be recorded as 3:1. 
  * We use standard rounding, where 0.5 rounds up.
  * Note that the final game score could be different to all the simulation scores, as it is the case here.

The game outcome is decided based on the game scores.
  * The winning team is the one who has scored more goals.
  * If both teams scored the same number of goals then the game is a draw.

Problem:
  Your task is to reconstruct the result of each game given:
    * the total number of goals scored
    * goals conceded and 
    * points earned by each team

Input:
  Your code will receive as input the following values, each on a separate line:
    * N, the number of teams.
    * W, the number of points awarded for winning a game.
    * D, the number of points awarded for drawing a game.
    * X, the number of simulations per game.
    * N lines, where the i-th line contains the final result of the i-th team formatted as:
        "goals_scored goals_conceded points_earned" (without the quotes)

Output:
  Your code should write to output the following:
    * On the first line, K=N*(N-1)/2, the total number of games played.
    * K lines, where the i-th line contains your predicted result for the i-th game.
    * Each line should be formatted as:
        * "scored1 scored2" (without the quotes), 
        * where scored1 is the number of goals scored by the first team and 
        * scored2 is the number of goals scored by the second team.
    * The order of the games is given by this pseudo-code:
        i=0
        for team1 = 0 to N-1
          for team2 = team1+1 to N
            //i-th game is between team1 and team2
            i++

TopCoder points:
  You will receive 1 point for predicting a game's outcome (win, loss, draw) correctly.
  You will receive an additional 2 points for also predicting the game's exact score.

==========================================

Here is an example solution for seed=1 with N=6, W=3, D=1 and X=1.
This solution predicts that each game ends in a 1:1 draw.
Five of the games finished in a draw and two of them were exactly 1:1, so the solution achieves 5*1 + 2*2 = 9 points.

INPUT:
team 0 scored 5 conceded 10 points 2
team 1 scored 4 conceded 12 points 1
team 2 scored 6 conceded 4 points 10
team 3 scored 9 conceded 4 points 9
team 4 scored 4 conceded 5 points 5
team 5 scored 11 conceded 4 points 13

OUTPUT:
game 0, team 0 vs team 1, predicted 1:1 actual 2:2 Correct outcome!
game 1, team 0 vs team 2, predicted 1:1 actual 1:2 Wrong
game 2, team 0 vs team 3, predicted 1:1 actual 1:3 Wrong
game 3, team 0 vs team 4, predicted 1:1 actual 1:1 Correct outcome and score!
game 4, team 0 vs team 5, predicted 1:1 actual 0:2 Wrong
game 5, team 1 vs team 2, predicted 1:1 actual 1:2 Wrong
game 6, team 1 vs team 3, predicted 1:1 actual 0:3 Wrong
game 7, team 1 vs team 4, predicted 1:1 actual 0:2 Wrong
game 8, team 1 vs team 5, predicted 1:1 actual 1:3 Wrong
game 9, team 2 vs team 3, predicted 1:1 actual 0:0 Correct outcome!
game 10, team 2 vs team 4, predicted 1:1 actual 1:0 Wrong
game 11, team 2 vs team 5, predicted 1:1 actual 1:2 Wrong
game 12, team 3 vs team 4, predicted 1:1 actual 1:1 Correct outcome and score!
game 13, team 3 vs team 5, predicted 1:1 actual 2:2 Correct outcome!
game 14, team 4 vs team 5, predicted 1:1 actual 0:2 Wrong
